# FPC软板设计
导体和柔性介质之间使用胶粘合，介电常数比较低。阻抗匹配一致性较差。 <br>
常用介质材料：聚酰亚胺(polyimide)，简称PI，厚度范围是0.5mil到5mil。|聚酯(polyester)，简称PET，厚度范围是1mil到5mil，焊接性能和抗撕裂能力差。<br>
导电材料：铜箔(Copper foil)：根据制造方式分类，包括电解铜箔和压延铜箔。|导电涂料：如银浆。<br>
为什么硬板绿油比较多：因为透光性比较好。<br>
连接方式：1.板对板连接器-需要公母连接器配对使用；2.Hotbar（使用设备进行组装，进行两个材料热压处理，处理采用电镀铅锡的方式）；3.软硬结合板。<br>
